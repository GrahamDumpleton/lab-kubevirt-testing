In this workshop we will setup a small Kubernetes cluster from scratch using
`kubeadm`. The Kubernetes cluster will consist of a single master node and two
worker nodes. The instructions will cover not only how to use `kubeadm` to run
the Kubernetes control plain on the master node, and add the worker nodes into
the cluster, but also the steps which are required to pre-configure the Fedora
Linux nodes we will be using.
